# Youtube Challenge

## https://unilingo-youtube.vercel.app/

## Application that uses the YouTube API to allow a user to enter a URL and retrieve the corresponding title of that video, its latest comment, the number of visitors the application has had, and other functionalities such as viewing all comments on a particular video, the last video searched by another user, and even listening to a portion of the video's audio, among other features. This application is still under development, but nevertheless, we can see its responsive design so that you can also use it on your tablet or mobile phone!
